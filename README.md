Owlculus is a comprehensive OSINT case management platform built for solo work or investigative teams. Manage cases,
collaborate, and run OSINT tools directly in your browser.

**100% free and open-source forever, no matter what.**

> **Active Development**: Note that Owlculus is under active development. Run `git pull` in the repo root regularly for
> updates. Never deploy the "
> dev" branch to production!

## Features

- **Case Management**: Create and track cases with customizable report numbering
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: Role-based access controls (Admin, Investigator, Analyst)
- **Entity System**: Track individual people, companies, domains, IP addresses, and vehicles each with dedicated
  notetaking
- **Evidence Management**: Organized file storage with folder templates and integration with the browser extension
- **OSINT Plugin Ecosystem**: Run popular open-source and custom OSINT tools right in your browser
- **Cross-Case Correlation**: Discover connections between investigations with the Correlation Scan plugin
- **Automated Hunts**: Multi-step OSINT workflows for comprehensive research (WIP)
- **Browser Extension**: Capture web pages as HTML or screenshots as you investigate and save directly to case evidence
- **RESTful API**: Complete API backend for easy automation and integrations

## Running Locally (Docker or Podman)

Owlculus ships with Docker Compose manifests that also work with Podman. The `Makefile` and helper scripts auto-detect
whichever engine you have installed, so the same commands work across platforms.

### Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2 **or** Podman 4.4+ (which includes `podman compose`)
- `make` (pre-installed on most macOS/Linux distros; install via `sudo apt install make` inside WSL)

For Windows users without Docker Desktop, you can run everything inside WSL using Podman:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install podman podman-compose
podman --version
```

If you are using Podman on Windows outside of WSL, initialise the Podman machine once:

```bash
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/be0vlk/owlculus.git
cd owlculus

# Start the development stack (auto-detects docker or podman)
make start-dev

# Visit the frontend (default): http://localhost:5173
# API (default): http://localhost:8000
```

To stop the stack run `make stop`. If compose detection fails for your setup, override it explicitly:

```bash
COMPOSE_CMD="podman compose" make start-dev
```

The same `COMPOSE_CMD` variable works with helper scripts, including `./scripts/run_test_data.sh`.

### Running Podman Rootful on WSL

WSL currently lacks the `tun` kernel module, so rootless Podman networking is unreliable. Run the stack with rootful
permissions instead:

```bash
sudo podman system migrate   # once, ensures root storage is initialised
sudo COMPOSE_CMD="podman compose" make start-dev
```

If you only need the backend/frontend (for example when using an external database), you can skip dependencies:

```bash
sudo COMPOSE_CMD="podman compose" podman compose up --no-deps backend frontend
```

### Using an External PostgreSQL

You can point Owlculus at a PostgreSQL instance that lives outside your container host (for example, a Flux-managed
Bitnami deployment on your RaspberryÂ Pi cluster). Update environment variables before starting the stack:

```bash
export POSTGRES_HOST=192.168.1.50        # Cluster node or load balancer
export POSTGRES_PORT=31432               # NodePort or load balancer port
export POSTGRES_USER=owlculus
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=gGiknNX7MbKfc8rQCXlt2ThUl
export POSTGRES_DB=owlculus

sudo COMPOSE_CMD="podman compose" podman compose up --no-deps backend frontend db-init
```

With Flux, add the `clusters/my-cluster/apps/owlculus-postgres` kustomization and the Bitnami chart will provision a
stateful PostgreSQL with persistent storage and a NodePort (31432 by default).
